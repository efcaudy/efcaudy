- 👋 Hi, I'm Ethan Caudy (@efcaudy)
  
  I've got a B.S. in Psychology, own Forest Wing Chun, and have always loved tech of all kinds. About ten years after I graduated, I'm taking the experience I've gained and shifting my career outlook into Computer Science. I've always loved everything about technology and learning how things work, and still have a few middle-school notebooks lying around my house with HTML and CSS scribbled in between math problems. Now I've committed to turning that love into something practical, and have had a blast so far.
