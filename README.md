- üëã Hi, I'm Ethan Caudy (@efcaudy)
  
  I've got a B.S. in Psychology, own Forest Wing Chun, and have always loved tech of all kinds. About ten years after I graduated, I took the experience I gained and shifted my career into Computer Science. I've always loved everything about technology and learning how things work, and still have a few middle-school notebooks lying around my house with HTML and CSS scribbled in between math problems. I committed to turning that love into something practical, and have had a blast so far. My education in software engineering has largely been through Harvard via EdX, and I'm professionally certified as a Python developer through their platform.

  My experience with Psychology intersects with my skills as a developer to inform a user-centric philosophy in my work. Every human involved in a business is part of the user experience - from the customer to the C-Suite. Software design should be as easy, efficient, and pleasant to interact with as possible - just as much for internal users (employees and admin) as it is for external users (customers and consumers). This isn't just movitated by altruism: employees who don't dread interacting with your software will be more motivated, productive, and waste less time grappling with simple tasks. Satisfied, motivated users translates directly to success in the corporate sphere. Long-term vision is needed in the approach to systems engineering to build genuine success, rather than temporary margins.

  Combine user-centrism with a "complementarity principle" approach to automation (see https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2841313), and you have a decent outline of my perspective for design.
